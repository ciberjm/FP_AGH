FP_AGH Version 0.1 by Juan Miguel Lechuga

1. Idea: 
	- Player in first person perspective shoots enemies preventing them to reach the player.
	- The player must not be reached by the enemies and should stay on the platform.
	- Every time the player kills an enemy, he recovers the bullet used to kill it.
	- Player never wins. He just scores depending on enemies and time achieved.

2. Tasks:
	- Level:
		- Just a rectangular platform
	- Enemies:
		- Enemy spawner:
			- Static
			- Spawns hug-enemies over time
		- Enemy hugger:
			- Spawns from a random point of the platform (Level defined)
			- Always tries to reach the player position
			- Only one point of life
			- When dies, player gets one bullet
	- Bullet counter:
		- Increases if enemy gets killed
		- Decreases when player shoots
	- Player:
		- FPS camera
		- Can shoot with LMB
		- Moves with WASD and jumps with SPACE, crouches with CTRL key
	- Shooting system:
		- Bullets must come from the gun to the point where the crosshair is looking to.
	- Gameplay:

		- Spawns enemies over time
		- Timer and enemy killed counter
		- When player dies, display a score depending on the player time and enemies killed
